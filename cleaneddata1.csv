I often wonder if the hatred displayed by other minorities toward people of Asian background is based on jealousy and envy that they were able to overcome the hatred and discrimination to better themselves, thus proving the falsehood of pushing the theory that the legacy of slavery and discrimination is what is holding some people back from enjoying the American dream.","School,Museums,Own reading",NA,5,5,A great deal,Very proud,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,A little,"While there are many inequities in US laws/institutions, necessary changes can be made by working within the current systems",All of the above,13,$10,$5,$10,NA,$5,Married,NA,Completed postgraduate degree,Full time employment,NA,"Combined household earnings above $135,000",57701,Nebraska,Not at all diverse,"Yes, once or twice a year",Nothing I can think of right off the top of my head.,623a0f2a-9dbf-31ca-f6d0-431fe5ad0282,1,3,NA,1,NA,1443,NA,NA,Legacyquestions|FL_52,Gameround2|Gameround1,NA,NA,0,White Conservative

I experience racism at an early age in the 1950-60s.  Slavery gave birth to racism and continued mistreatment of black people.  America has still not adapted to racism and is still growing in the shedding of this taught and infectious practice of hatred against black people in America, especially the deep south. Slavery is still being dealt with since the Civil War.",NA,Somewhat disagree,"The Democratic Party is the most dangerous and biased agent that keep Black people under the realms of racism and former Civil Rights movement. The Democratic party was the Ku Klux Klan and continued to migrate its way to overtake and influence many educated Blacks to join with them under the disguise of civil rights with the intention of destroying black men, families, and ultimately make them believe that their political participation in American politics could only be achieved through this party.  The deceit and double standards practiced by the Democrats later learned by educated Blacks who captured the so-called dream instead achieved personal success by copying the Democratic ways of patronizing Blacks at voting time and blaming the opposition party of hatred and racism to keep Black votes. The Civil Rights movement that led to Dr. Martin Luther King's contribution for equal rights for all was quickly extinguished because he was right, and the population caught hold of the dream. Thus was the end of any type of Civil rights movement in America. The opportunity created by the suffering and sacrifices of Black and White Americans who stood for Civil Rights are the reason the Black People in America, descendants of slaves; are given the choice of receiving education, job opportunity, and other experiences most citizens enjoy, if permitted to when there is an opportunity to choose.  Poverty has prevented many Black people from being successful because of the hatred and racism embedded in local, state, and Federal government; awork in progress until this day! I am proud to be an American from Charleston, SC.  A poor black family; born to a 16 year black teen Mother; lving in a shot gun house next to the railroad. From these meager beginnings, attending public segregated elementary school; snatched up in 1968 to attend forced integration at white high school for four years, and finally my senior year forced integration to another all white school because that community refused to integrate with black people.  The results could have been devastating for me. I made the choice to stay and graduate.  I believe one teacher just passed me so I would not return for another credit to graduate.  Joined the US Army because my draft number was 31.  Instead of the draft I volunteered with hopes of not going to Vietnam.  Now we find that the war was a fraud of politicians.  Clinton was right; Ali was right; many died suffered because of greedy, racist, and political figures.  Thank God a few lived to tell the truth before passing on. Talk about civil rights...God help us all.  By the way I retired from the US Army, Sergeants Major E9 after 25 years and some months; graduated Strayer University 2002 BSBA and 2004 MBA Cum Laude; finally worked with several major Contract companies; retired from Department of Homeland Security as senior security specialist in 2018.  I recently got called back for an opportunity to contribute to my country at department of defense in Nov 2020. I am a senior consultant for an Intelligence and Security Division.  This success I contribute to those that sacrificed and gave their life during the Civil Rights Movement.",NA,Strongly agree,"Many of these people, like me, do not have the education, live in poverty, and lack parental guidance and may do not know direction to move in after being bombarded with fiction, television, society domination and lies.

The country thought very differently than we do today.  Each state was considered sovereign but they depended on each other.  The south wanted to export goods which could get them better money than the industrial states paid.  The north wanted the south's money - they wanted to control production and execution.  The south didn't want to pay the price.  The north wanted control.  Slavery or not, control and power was more important as was all the money involved.

Today individuals are still suffering for the decisions made in the mid-nineth",Somewhat disagree,"Initially the north did nothing to help the freed slaves and left them to create a new culture in order to survive which did not work well.  Then Jim Crow laws were established than made life more difficult.  Increased need for worker resulted in the Great Migration to the north while the Jim Crow mentality continued in the south.  Everyone has done well and everyone has done poorly to reach these goals but the major drawback is blaming each other rather than seeing the values of others.

By the '60s, working class white people in cities like Boston already had a sense that they were going no farther, that their schools were crap and their children were behind the 8 ball; the idea of busing them to crappier schools so students from those schools could take their place seemed like a betrayal.

Servants were not subject to minimum wage - so the nice ladies who cleaned your house, washed your clothes, cooked your meals, tended your babies and elders, had no say in how many hours they had to work to make whatever you'd agreed to pay them per week.  Neither did their husbands, who worked your fields, chopped your tobacco, cared for your horses and cows.

In the Depression, we created a lot of programs aimed at destitute white women whose husbands had run off, and that model stuck, making it impossible for low income families to stay together and get public assistance: all those high rise housing projects like Cabrini Green in Chicago were designed to make husbands disappear.  Stuyvesant Town in NYC was aimed at lower middle class white GIs coming home, and it remains a great place to live.
And here's the biggie: the GI Bill.  It was largely unaccessible to Black vets.  They couldn't buy in any of the new suburbs being built, and the places where they COULD buy were often deemed unworthy of loans: talk about Catch 22.
